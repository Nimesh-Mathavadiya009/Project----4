# I've developed a comprehensive User Data Management System that showcases my skills in Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates). Here are some key features:

# View User Data: Users can see a list of all usernames, emails, and passwords.
# Add New Users: Easily add new users to the system.
# Edit User Data: Users can edit information if the correct password is provided.
# User Count: Quickly see the total number of users.
# Delete Users: Users can delete a record if the correct email and password are provided.
 
 ðŸ‘‰To generate realistic dummy data, I used the Faker package, which provides random user IDs, usernames, emails, and passwords. For the database, I integrated the MySQL2 package, ensuring efficient and reliable data management.

ðŸ‘‰Tech stack:

# Backend: Node.js, Express.js
# Frontend: EJS
# Database: MySQL2
# Data Generation: Faker
